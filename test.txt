I am an ARC DECRA Research Fellow and Senior Lecturer at  RMIT University  in the  School of Computer Science & Information Technology . I run the  Algorithm Design Lab (ADL)  which is closely affiliated with the Information Storage and Retrieval (ISAR) Research Group ran by Professor Mark Sanderson, and the Big Data and Data Analytics (BDDA) Research Group ran by Professor Timos Sellis.

		 Research 

My current work focuses on how to design efficient algorithms and data structures for a wide variety of information storage and retrieval problems. Broadly speaking my research interests include information retrieval, text indexing, data compression, natural language processing, experimental algorithmics, and scalable distributed/parallel computing. See my  research overview  and  publications  pages for more information.
